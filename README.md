## MNISTverse

This project is about learning machine learning concepts using only the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a dataset of handwritten digits. It is a good dataset to start learning machine learning concepts because it is small and easy to understand. The dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Each image is 28x28 pixels. The images are grayscale and the digits are centered.

## Progress

The project is for now composed of one main notebook: (main)[main.ipynb].
